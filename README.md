## Description

I made a web page that allows the user to search for github profiles. If you find a profile it will show: its profile image, its user, its description, how many followers it has, how many people it follows and how many repos it has. And it will make a list of buttons with each repo, also if you click on any repo it will take you to the official link of that repository in github. If it doesn't find it, it will launch an alert.

## Technologies used
